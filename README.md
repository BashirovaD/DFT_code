# DFT_code

## Session 1. Particle in the Box
In this section, we use Python code to calculate standard 3D PIB solutions for PAHs from benzene to hexacene. The results are expressed as an energy diagam as well as molecular orbitals or density visualization. <br />

## Session 2. Hartree Fock molecular orbitals
In this section, we use H-F/STO-3G calculations to find the frontier MO energies for PAHs. Molecular orbitals or densities can be visualized and directly compared to 3D PIB solutions. <br />

## Session 3. DFT
In this section, we use Python code to calculate DFT solutions for PAHs. Two choices for exchange-correlation functionals are implemented: LDA and GGA (PBE).
